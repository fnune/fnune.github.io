It's often tempting to define a type for key-value stores using TypeScript's `Record` if you don't know your object's keys during development.

```ts
type Record<K extends string, T> = { [P in K]: T }
```

By using it alongside a type that could be used for an infinite set of values as an argument for `K`, we're promising TypeScript that our object will contain a value of type `T` _for any key_. An object with values for an infinite set of keys does not exist, and by forgetting this we might introduce bugs in our code:

```ts
type Breed = string

interface Dog {
  name: string
}

const dogsByBreed: Record<Breed, Dog[]> = {
  akita: [{ name: 'Walter' }, { name: 'Gracie' }],
  dachshund: [{ name: 'Charlie' }],
}

dogsByBreed.poodle // Type is Dog[], value is undefined.
```

We never told TypeScript that our property access may not return a value, so it will accept the type of the returned value to be `Dog[]`. Use your own type for these situations. Here are example implementations:

```ts
type Dictionary<K extends string, T> = Partial<Record<K, T>>
type Dictionary<K extends string, T> = { [P in K]?: T }

// If you need to support numbers and symbols as keys:
type Dictionary<K extends keyof any, T> = Partial<Record<K, T>>
type Dictionary<K extends keyof any, T> = { [P in K]?: T }

const dogsByBreed: Dictionary<Breed, Dog[]> = {
  akita: [{ name: 'Walter' }, { name: 'Gracie' }],
  dachshund: [{ name: 'Charlie' }],
}

dogsByBreed.poodle // Type is Dog[] | undefined, value is undefined.
```

This way, you'll be forced to handle the `undefined` case.

Ideal use of the `Record` type requires knowledge during development of the specific keys that will be used. You can do this by using a discriminated union type with literals:

```ts
type Breed = 'akita' | 'dachshund'

const dogsByBreed: Record<Breed, Dog[]> = {
  akita: [{ name: 'Walter' }, { name: 'Gracie' }],
  dachshund: [{ name: 'Charlie' }],
}

// Here, the compiler will yield a type error:
// Property 'poodle' does not exist on type 'Record<Breed, Dog[]>'.
dogsByBreed.poodle
```

## The `satisfies` operator

The release of TypeScript 4.9 includes a new operator called `satisfies`. It can be used to avoid the need for a `Dictionary` typed. Read more about it in [the TypeScript 4.9 release announcement][typescript-4.9]{:target="\_blank"} or in [my post about using `Record` together with the `satisfies` operator][new-post].
